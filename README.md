The game begins with an engaging main menu screen that greets players upon launch. The menu offers various options, but the highlight is the "Play" button, which transports players into the heart of the game.

Once in the game, players find themselves in a visually captivating environment where they control a shooter plane. The objective is to navigate through a series of three progressively challenging levels. Each level introduces new obstacles and opponents, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.

The game mechanics allow players to control the shooter plane's movement using arrow keys. The plane responds to player input, allowing for precise navigation and tactical positioning. As the shooter plane moves, it automatically shoots at approaching opponents, creating a seamless and immersive gaming experience.

As players progress through the levels, they encounter increasingly formidable opponents and face heightened challenges. The final level, Level 3, stands apart with its distinct gameplay mechanics and increased intensity. Level 3 is implemented as a separate assembly language file named "level3.asm," showcasing modular programming practices.

Level 3 introduces a formidable boss monster that not only shoots back at the player but also exhibits dynamic movement patterns, making it a thrilling and challenging encounter. Players must showcase their skills to defeat the boss monster and emerge victorious.

The graphics play a pivotal role in the game's overall appeal and immersion. The game leverages assembly language's graphics capabilities to render captivating visuals, enhancing the player's gaming experience and adding a layer of excitement to the gameplay.

Overall, the Alien Shooter Game project combines assembly language programming, graphics, and dynamic gameplay to deliver an exhilarating gaming experience.
